### 📝 Notes
- Results are reported on the **held-out test dataset (15%)**
- **Recall is emphasized** for defect classes, as missing defects has higher impact
- Performance variations are influenced by **class imbalance** and **limited samples** in certain defect categories
- These results represent a **Phase-1 baseline**, focusing on correctness, portability, and compact model size
