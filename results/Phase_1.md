📝 Notes

Results are reported on the held-out test dataset (15%)

Recall is emphasized for defect classes, as missing defects has higher impact

Performance variations are influenced by class imbalance and limited samples in certain defect categories

These results represent a Phase-1 baseline, focusing on correctness, portability, and compact model size

🧩 Confusion Matrix

📌 The confusion matrix image is attached separately.

🚀 Phase-2 Improvement Strategy

Address class imbalance using targeted data collection and augmentation

Fine-tune the last layers of MobileNetV2 for improved defect discrimination

Apply model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning) to further reduce size and improve edge efficiency

Validate optimized models using ONNX Runtime and prepare for edge hardware deployment

🔮 Phase-2 Summary (One Line)

Phase-2 will focus on improving accuracy and edge efficiency through data balancing, selective fine-tuning, and model compression.
