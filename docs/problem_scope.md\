FINAL PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Semiconductor fabrication facilities rely on high-resolution inspection systems such as optical inspection and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to detect wafer and die-level defects.
These inspection tools generate large volumes of image data, making centralized inspection pipelines prone to high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, and increased operational cost.
Manual defect review further limits scalability in high-throughput manufacturing environments.
There is a need for a real-time, scalable defect classification solution that can operate close to the inspection source.
Deploying lightweight deep learning models on edge devices enables fast defect screening while reducing data transfer and infrastructure overhead.
